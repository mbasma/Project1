    	<div class="description"><h2>HTML Coding</h2> 
            <p>HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language, is used to create a Web site. Among other things, it tells your Web browser what text to display, what images will appear, and what color a table border should be as well as dictating how everything is laid out.</p>

    	<div class="description"><h2>HTML Basic</h2>
    	 <p>HTML is nothing but text and tags. The text is simple to create it, just type or paste it in. Tags, on theother hand, are a different story.There are two main parts to an HTML document: the head and the body. In that sentence, I mentioned three HTML tags: HTML, HEAD, and BODY. You must begin every HTML document with the tag html <span style="color:Blue">(normally read "open HTML")</span> and end every document with /html (read "end HTML").<br>
         The process of creating an end tag is also known as closing the tag. In your HTML document, you must also open and close head and body tags.
         The HEAD section of an HTML document allows you to title your document and include other pieces ofdata, such as META tags and scripts
         The title of your document will appear in the Title Bar of the browser window. To title your document, simply place the title between the opening and closing TITLE tags</p></div>
         <div class="description"><h2>The BODY section</h2>
            <p>The BODY section of an HTML document is where all the action occurs. Here is where you get to put your HTML writing skills to the test.The BODY tag can consist of other keywords placed in the same tag. Such words, called parameters, include BACKGROUND, BGCOLOR, TEXT, LINK, ALINK, and VLINK. These parameter names don't leave much to the imagination when trying to figure out what they mean, which is one of the reasons why HTML is so easy to understand.</p>
          <h3>Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.</h3>
            <p>
            <b>Avoiding Errors:</b> when HTML programmers don't avoid repetition, they will often have repeate the same thing multiple times. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise. for example the class called description is used to apply font size color...to HTML element instead of reapting font size, color background ...every time.

          <h2>Building a Structure</h2>
          <p>web pages were built using divisions which provided no precise value and hence the structured based element come to play including 
            <em>Header, nav, article</em>...all these element give meaning to organization of our pages and improve the structure.</p>
          <h2>CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
                <p>Short for Cascading Style Sheets, a new feature being added to HTML that gives both Web site developers and users more control over how pages are displayed. With CSS, designers and users can create style sheets that define how different elements, such as headers and links, appear. These style sheets can then be applied to any Web page.This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <em> class="code" </em> class name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.</P>
                <h2>Adding a picture</h2>
                <p>If you would like a picture file as the background of your Web page, the BACKGROUND parameter should be used. This instruction will display the file background.gif as wallpaper for the Web page.</p>
